        <h2>School Experiance</h2>
        <p>Back when I was school in IBTE Jefri Bolkiah,
 I have to live in the hostel for two long years
 since my place is far away from the school. Fortunately
 I can go home at saturday and go back at sunday.

 At that time there are many life experiance in the hostel
 such as how to live without parents around, when was the lunch
 at the cafetaria start and end, where to buy resources and
 rules and regulation on hostel which can be brought outside the
 hostel.

 As for my experiance at school, there are many things to study,
 many works to do, many challanging projects to attempt. For me
 most difficult subject there is basic programming because there
 are so many codes to remember, understand how it use and when it
 use and how to execute it. other than that there are clubs there
 that you can join and have some fun in the afternoon, if there are
 no interest in club on the list, you can make your own club.

 In conclusion, it is an enjoyable school for everyone who wants
 to enter it. from this school you can have good education and
 can easily have good grade for your future in finding a school
 with high level study and finding a suitable job which can be
 related to your study in this school.</p>

      <div class="My-Achievements" id="My-Achievements">
        <h2>My Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elementary school year 6= 3C 2D</li>
          <li>SSSRU=grade 1 score 15</li>
          <li>SPE=pass</li>
          <li>O level= highest C in Bahasa Melayu</li>
          <li>IBTE Jefri Bolkiah graduate in Computer networking course= Grade 3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
so far the highest achievement of all is when I was in IBTE Jefri Bolkiah
which is Grade 3. That achievement alone give me the qualification I needed
to where I am now. other than that this achievement also give me many oppurtunity
on finding a suitable job with my skills acquired. However I choose to contunue
my study in Politeknik to obtain more knowledge that is suitable for my skill.
Not that Im saying that other studies doesnt support my education until now
like if it werent for my O level have 'just Pass' grade I wouldnt be entering
IBTE Jefri Bolkiah and graduate there. Also SSSRU to is needed to find a job
because without it Im jobless since the rules of the law says you need to get
it before getting a job. So in conclusion with all this achivement and skillset from it has brought me
to where I am now.</p>
